Background of the Study
-----
School dropout negatively impacts youth development as well as the social and economic vitality of the community. Targeting truancy among high-risk groups has been shown to reduce rates of drop out. In-depth study of absenteeism in India is particularly difficult due to poor data quality. The Center for Sustainable Development at the Earth Institute sought to address this problem by implementing a biometric system of daily attendance tracking.
