Project Summary
-----
We propose a project to develop a framework for ENSO prediction using a range of machine learning approaches and benchmark their skill against other methods. Identify observables that are most relevant for ENSO predictability at a particular timescale.

Data Description
-----
- Coarsened CESM2 Large Ensemble members (SST fields) from 1° to 3° resolution 
- Used the first 10 of 100 CESM2 LE members

Deep Learning Components
-----
- 2D CNN (ReLU/SeLU, adam/nadam/adamx)
- 3D CNN (ReLU/SeLU, adam/nadam/adamx)
- EOF/LSTM
- CNN/LSTM
- Baseline method (Persistence method, AR1 model)
