- Early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC) is rising in adults under 50, yet current screening guidelines typically exclude this age group. 
- This study investigated the potential of machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) to predict the risk of early-onset colorectal cancer (EoCRC) in individuals aged 18–44, utilizing the electronic health record (EHR) data within the last six months of the patient journey prior to CRC diagnoses. 
- A fine-tuned GPT-4o LLM outperformed other models—achieving 90%+ specificity even when disease prevalence was just 1%—and could help reduce unnecessary screenings. 
- These findings suggest LLMs may be a powerful tool for identifying rare cancers earlier in younger patients not covered by current screening protocols.
