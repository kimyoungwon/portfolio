Project Objective
-----
Our project intends to build a web tool to make log data informative for students and instructors. Using our web tool, students can visualize their learning progress and receive guidance for the course review to boost their final grades. Instructors can better understand their students’ academic performance and easily construct student groups for the group project, which would possibly have a relatively similar academic potential between groups.

You can see the EPM project from [this website](http://52.38.47.237/).
