Motivation and Background
-----
Families have become more diverse than previous generations. According to the study of McLanahan (2013), about 10 percent of infants were born to unmarried parents in 1970, but about 40 percent of infants were born to unmarried parents in 2006. Thus, there has been increasing interest in fragile families indicting those who include the unmarried or romantically unstable parents and their child(ren). 

Most of the parents in the fragile families are likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged (Carlson & McLanahan, 2010), experience unstable relationships (Durtshi, Soloski, & Kimmes, 2017), vulnerable to psychological and emotional stress and pressures by employment, income or other internal as well as external factors ((Bronte-Tinkew, Horowitz, & Carrano, 2010) in the parent’s life. This leads them to experience negative feelings such as anxiety, fears, frustration, or annoyance arising from the demands of being a caregiver or parent and have a hard time maintaining a positive relationship with their child (Bronte-Tinkew et al., 2010). 

The aggravation in parenting and the caregiver-child interaction are important in that previous studies showed that caregiver’s aggravation in parenting is associated with child behavior problems (Hofferth, Davis-Kean, Davis, & Finkelstein, 1997) and the quality of the parent-child relationship is related with academic performances among young children and adolescents (Yuan, Weiser, & Fischer, 2016). However, there is a lack of such studies on fragile families because most studies have focused more on general parents and their children. In this context, it is crucial to identify the aggravation in parenting and caregiver-child interaction and their impacts on academic performance. To identify a model to understand the associations between them, we will conduct regression analyses using general linear modeling and machine learning.
