Hello and welcome!

I am a Machine Learning Postdoctoral Researcher at Truveta, where I develop Clinical AI and foundation models to transform the patient journey. By leveraging large-scale, longitudinal Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, I build predictive architectures—including LLM-based risk models and oncology foundation models—designed to forecast disease progression and improve clinical outcomes for high-risk conditions such as cancer and heart failure.

My approach is defined by a rigorous foundation in Measurement & Statistics (Ph.D., University of Washington) and advanced causal inference training (Postdoc, Harvard University). My background is uniquely multidisciplinary; I have successfully pivoted from a deep focus on psychometrics and human behavior to high-dimensional healthcare analytics. This evolution allows me to blend classical techniques, such as latent variable modeling and multilevel analysis, with modern AI workflows like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and automated prompt optimization.

🚀 Core Expertise & Impact
Clinical AI & Foundation Models: I architect longitudinal ML/LLM systems to predict health state transitions. This includes building Chain-of-Agents frameworks for oncology risk prediction (specifically early-onset colorectal cancer) and developing automated frameworks for clinical outcome estimation, such as KCCQ scores in heart failure.

NLP & Automated Evaluation: I specialize in applying language models to complex, human-centric data. At Harvard, I developed the 'rcttext' R package to integrate NLP into randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and led comparative research on LLMs versus traditional ML for high-stakes tasks like automated essay scoring.

Advanced Statistical Methodology: Rooted in my doctoral research on factor analysis and modern prediction algorithms, I bridge the gap between classical statistics and modern AI. My focus is on improving model interpretability and ensuring algorithms are used to drive equitable societal change.

💡 My Mission
My mission is to advance the frontier of Clinical AI while maintaining a steadfast commitment to equity and social good. Whether identifying disparities in teacher retention or predicting health state transitions in oncology, I aim to foster positive societal change through technological innovation.

I am always eager to collaborate with peers dedicated to the intersection of data science, healthcare, and human behavior.
