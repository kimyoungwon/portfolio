Hello and welcome!

I'm a passionate researcher leveraging advanced statistics and machine learning (ML) to drive meaningful social change. 

Currently, as an ML Postdoctoral Researcher at Truveta, I focus on patient journey projects, utilizing large-scale, timestamped EHR data with ML and large language models (LLMs). My work involves building foundational language models and developing predictive models to forecast patient future status and improve outcomes for at-risk individuals with conditions such as cancer or heart failure.

My background includes a Ph.D. in Measurement & Statistics from the University of Washington and a postdoctoral fellowship at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. During my doctoral studies, I developed deep expertise in quantitative methods, including ML modeling, multilevel analysis, latent variable modeling, and social network analysis. At Harvard, I advanced statistical text analysis for randomized controlled trials, creating the 'rcttext' R package to automate human coding and enhance large-scale analysis. I also conducted research on writing quality estimation and stance classification using ML and LLMs.

My commitment lies in advancing equity and delivering impactful research in healthcare, education, behavioral science, and psychology. My ultimate goal is to use data and technology to not only gain insights, but to improve lives and foster positive societal change. 

I'm always happy to connect with fellow researchers and professionals enthusiastic about leveraging data for social good. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, playing soccer, and continuously learning.
